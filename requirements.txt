# --- Core Deep Learning Framework ---
#torch>=2.0.0 # Or the specific version recommended for your CUDA setup (see note below)
             # E.g., torch==2.2.1+cu121 for CUDA 12.1

# --- Numerical and Scientific Computing ---
numpy
scipy # Useful for advanced math functions, e.g., specific wavelet mother functions
pandas

# --- Utility Libraries ---
tqdm # For elegant progress bars in loops
matplotlib # For plotting and visualization
seaborn # For statistical data visualization
scikit-learn # For machine learning utilities, e.g., train-test split, metrics
# --- Wavelet Transform Libraries ---
tensorboard # For experiment tracking, logging metrics, and visualizing models/data
einops # Highly recommended for flexible and readable tensor operations (reshaping, transposing etc.)

# --- Development & Testing (Optional, but good practice) ---
pytest # For unit testing (if you plan to write tests, which you should!)
black # For code formatting (to keep your code clean and consistent)
isort # For sorting imports
